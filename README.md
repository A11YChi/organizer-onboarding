## Expecations: Understanding and Empathy

A11YChi is an environment where one should feel encouraged to share their unique perspectives, leverage their strengths, and act authentically. [Briefly explain more]

- A11YChi interacts with many diverse abilities [Note: Discuss more deeply about consent, phrasing, etc. Basically, how do we as organizers make A11YChi meetups always inclusive]

### Communications

- Asynchronous first, real-time second (In-person meetings as the last resort)
- Reasonable expectations to protect the organizers' time and attention
- Timeframe for responding: [Note: Determine what's the reasonable timeframe - 48-hour?]

1. Establish how you would prefer to be addressed and contacted
    - What is your pronouns to be identified as when we communicate with you? If you do not want to share, it's totally okay.
    - Do you have a preferred communication channel(s), e.g. Slack, email, text, that we'll contact you if an urgent matter arises?
        - [Note: Determine the max amount of contact]
2. Notify us that if there is any circumstance that will prevent you from fulfilling your task(s), either between or during meetups. [Note: Clarify more how this would work]
3. Inform us if you are in need of rest/break from organizing [Note: Clarify more how this would work]
